# 🚶‍♀️ Open Sidewalks LA 🚶‍♂️

## 🌟 About

Open Sidewalks LA is a grassroots initiative started by a small group of neighbors in Los Angeles. We're organizing around the critical issue of access to public streets, with a focus on removing barriers that impede mobility and accessibility for all residents. 🏙️

Our mission was sparked by the story of an elderly disabled man who had to walk an additional 0.5 miles around gates in Country Club Park just to catch his bus. 🚌 This highlighted the urgent need for more inclusive and accessible public spaces in our community.

## 🎯 Our Goals

1. 🚸 Improve accessibility in public spaces
2. 🚧 Remove unnecessary barriers and gates that restrict movement
3. 🗣️ Advocate for the rights of pedestrians, especially those with mobility challenges
4. 🏙️ Create a more walkable and connected Los Angeles

## 📈 Progress

- 📝 We have collected over 250 signatures in support of opening the gates in Country Club Park.
- [Add any other achievements or milestones here]

## 🔍 Current Activities

We are currently engaged in two important research initiatives:

1. 📚 Collecting historical news articles about Los Angeles losing access to public roads.
2. 📊 Conducting data collection to revisit theories around crime rates in relation to public access.
